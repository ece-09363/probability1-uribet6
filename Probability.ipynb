    "Around 1700, Jacob Bernoulli wrote about removing colored balls from an urn in his landmark treatise *[Ars Conjectandi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Conjectandi)*, and ever since then, explanations of probability have relied on [urn problems](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=probability%20ball%20urn). (You'd think the urns would be empty by now.) \n",

    "\n",
    "For example, here is a three-part problem [adapted](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/69151.html)  from mathforum.org:\n",
    "\n",
    "> An urn contains 23 balls: 8 white, 6 blue, and 9 red.  We select six balls at random (each possible selection is equally likely). What is the probability of each of these possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. all balls are red\n",
    "2. 3 are blue, 2 are white, and 1 is red\n",
    "3. exactly 4 balls are white\n",
    "\n",
    "So, an outcome is a set of 6 balls, and the sample space is the set of all possible 6 ball combinations. We'll solve each of the 3 parts using our `P` function, and also using basic arithmetic; that is, *counting*. Counting is a bit tricky because:\n",
    "- We have multiple balls of the same color. \n",
    "- An outcome is a *set* of balls, where order doesn't matter, not a *sequence*, where order matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the first issue, I'll have 8 different white balls labeled `'W1'` through `'W8'`, rather than having eight balls all labeled `'W'`.  That makes it clear that selecting `'W1'` is different from selecting `'W2'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second issue is handled automatically by the `P` function, but if I want to do calculations by hand, I will sometimes first count the number of *permutations* of balls, then get the number of *combinations* by dividing the number of permutations by *c*!, where *c* is the number of balls in a combination. For example, if I want to choose 2 white balls from the 8 available, there are 8 ways to choose a first white ball and 7 ways to choose a second, and therefore 8 &times; 7 = 56 permutations of two white balls. But there are only 56 / 2 = 28 combinations, because `(W1, W2)` is the same combination as `(W2, W1)`.\n",
